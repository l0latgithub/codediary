Here is my journey to relearn programming, data structure, and computer algorithms. I started to learn fortran programming when I was a freshman in college. After starting my graduate study in 2000, I was thinking of becoming a software engineer and passed the Advanced Software Engineer certification exam in 2002.

Life is unpredictable and I did not pursue my software engineer career. Instead I started my PhD study in 2004 in the United States and happened to find leetcode.com around 2005. However the first question two sum (https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) takes me more than an hour to get and understand the O(n) solution. I was so frustrated and thought I am not the material of software engineering.

In 2020, life had so many changes and made me think about what to do for the future. Do I want a job or a career? Can I do something that could bring my family a better life and something positive for other people. 

I realized software engineer and machine learning are something I really want to do, Here is my diary for coding and will do things enthusiastically everyday!
